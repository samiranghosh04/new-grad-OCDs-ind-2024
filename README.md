#### Important FREE Resource that practically everyone misses out on. 
Please register yourself on the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) if you are eligible. Trust me on this one. There are tonnes of free resources for skill development and interview prep. This also makes you eligible for [GitHub Octernships](https://education.github.com/globalcampus/octernships) (given that you also have a handful of Open Source Contributions and the technical acumen to fulfill any prerequisites for a given role offered through it i.e. suppose the role asks for basics of MERN - then you should have a decent understanding of MERN.). The stipends are amazing, the internship experiences are extremely valuable and you get to learn a lot. Trust me on this one. I regret that I haven't discovered this earlier.

## Mental Health Resources

Embarking on your tech career journey as a new graduate during a recession comes with its own set of challenges. This section is dedicated to equipping you with essential mental health and well-being resources specifically tailored to the unique circumstances you might encounter. As you navigate the dynamic landscape of the tech industry, remember that facing rejection or encountering difficulty in finding promising leads does not diminish your worth or potential.

The resources compiled here are designed to offer you the support you need to manage the emotional toll that job searching during uncertain times can bring. From helplines that provide empathetic listening to online platforms that offer professional counseling, these resources are here to guide you through the highs and lows of pursuing a tech role. Embrace the understanding that your journey might include setbacks, but these setbacks do not define you. Rejections or challenges are not indicators of your abilities or character; rather, they are a part of the learning process in a competitive field.

In the ever-evolving world of technology, the importance of mental well-being cannot be overstated. Prioritizing self-care and seeking help when needed will not only contribute to your personal growth but will also fortify your resilience in the face of adversity. Remember, your journey is unique, and each experience‚Äîwhether it's a success or a challenge‚Äîadds to your story. By taking care of your mental health, you're setting the foundation for a successful and fulfilling career in the tech industry.

## Off-Campus Drives

The "Off-Campus Drives" section in the New Grad Tech Roles - India repository features information about upcoming off-campus recruitment drives. This section provides details about eligibility criteria, locations, posting dates, exam dates, and application deadlines. Off-campus drives are opportunities for new graduates to showcase their skills and connect with tech companies outside of traditional on-campus recruitment. By participating in off-campus drives, candidates can access a broader range of job opportunities and potentially secure roles that align with their career aspirations. It's important to verify information from official sources and adhere to application deadlines for accurate and up-to-date details on off-campus drives.

<br><br><br>

| Off-Campus Drive | Eligibility Criteria | Location     | Date Posted <br> dd/mm/yyyy | Exam Date <br> dd/mm/yyyy | Application Deadline <br> dd/mm/yyyy |

## Diversity Programs

The "Diversity Programs" section within the New Grad Tech Roles - India repository is a dedicated resource showcasing initiatives by tech companies to promote inclusivity and diversity in their hiring practices. This section highlights programs that focus on supporting underrepresented groups, including but not limited to gender, race, sexuality, caste, and discrimination. These programs offer opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to excel in the tech industry, fostering a more inclusive and equitable work environment. Candidates can explore a variety of programs designed to provide mentorship, internships, and resources to help them succeed in their tech careers. Aspiring tech professionals can utilize this section to discover programs that align with their identities and aspirations, contributing to a more diverse tech landscape.

#### Note
The emphasis companies place on candidates' capabilities remains paramount, yet it's crucial to recognize the pivotal role that diversity programs play in STEM. Even companies like Amazon institute these programs to uplift marginalized communities such as women and people of color. However, the rigorous assessment processes are consistent across all candidates. Any perceived benefit tied to a specific background is dwarfed by the advantages of referrals, rendering it a minor, virtually inconsequential factor aimed at optics. Proficiency remains the key determinant in securing employment, irrespective of one's identity. Worries about bias during interviews are effectively countered through skill-based evaluations.

It's imperative to understand that the intention behind diversity programs is not to compromise on hiring quality; rather, it's to harness a broader range of talents and perspectives. Labeling these initiatives as unfair is not only misguided but also reflects a bigoted and ignorant viewpoint. These programs are designed to rectify systemic imbalances and create a more inclusive, innovative, and equitable STEM community, effectively debunking any baseless or prejudiced claims.
