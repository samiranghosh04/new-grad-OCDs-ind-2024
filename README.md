#### Important FREE Resource that practically everyone misses out on. 
Please register yourself on the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) if you are eligible. Trust me on this one. There are tonnes of free resources for skill development and interview prep. This also makes you eligible for [GitHub Octernships](https://education.github.com/globalcampus/octernships) (given that you also have a handful of Open Source Contributions and the technical acumen to fulfill any prerequisites for a given role offered through it i.e suppose the role asks for basics of MERN - then you should have a decent understanding of MERN.). The stipends are amazing, the internship experiences are extremely valuable and you get to learn a lot. Trust me on this one. I am regretting that I haven't discovered this earlier.
